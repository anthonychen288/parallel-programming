parallel-programming
=====
practicing various parallel programming techniques


## pthread
- Use *Monte Carlo* method to estimating the value of pi and use **pthread** library to parallelize the program

## OpenMP
- conjugate gradient with **openMP** programming

## MPI
- find the largest prime and the number of primes smaller than the input values.
- calculate the integrates of *sin(x)* over the range from 0 to pi using N intervals, where N is an input value.

## C with CUDA
- use **CUDA** to parallelize concurrent wave equation

## OpenCL
- use **OpenCL** to parallelize the implementation of image histogram, which needs to calcuate the pixel values (RGB) in an image.

## final project
- Color space transfer between images with **openMP**
